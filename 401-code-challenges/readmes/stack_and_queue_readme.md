# Stacks and Queues
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
Create a Queue and a Stack class, which behave as queues and stacks.

## Approach & Efficiency
All methods have a constant big O for space and time.

## API
  ### Stack
    push - Takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the top of the stack.
    pop - Removes the node from the top of the stack, and returns the node’s value.
    peek - Returns the value of the node located on top of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
  ### Queue
    enqueue - Takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue.
    dequeue - Removes the node from the front of the queue, and returns the node’s value.
    peek - Returns the value of the node located in the front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.
